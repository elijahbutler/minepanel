# Minepanel Frontend

Next.js dashboard for Minepanel.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Zustand

`next lint` was removed in Next.js 16; linting uses the ESLint CLI (`eslint src`)
with the flat config from `eslint-config-next` in `eslint.config.mjs`.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

App default URL: `http://localhost:3000`.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint
```

## Base Path

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` mounts the frontend under a subpath such as `/minepanel`.
- It is consumed from `next.config.ts`, so it must be set at build time.
- If you build with a subpath, keep the runtime `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` aligned for healthchecks and diagnostics.

## Structure

- `src/app/` - routes and layouts
- `src/components/` - UI composition
- `src/services/` - API calls
- `src/lib/store/` - global state
- `src/lib/translations/` - i18n

## Running server configuration

Configuration tabs remain open while a server is running. Saves update the stored
server configuration and apply when Minepanel next restarts the server with a
Compose down/up cycle. Network routing, Bedrock add-ons, and live files remain
read-only until the server stops. RCON credentials are also locked so live console
actions keep using the active container's credentials. World selections can be
saved while running and take effect on the next restart without touching the
active world.
